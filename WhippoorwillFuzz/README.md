# Whippoorwill Fuzz

The *Whippoorwill Fuzz* is a PCB based on the Dunwich Amplification Cthulhu ([circuit here](https://dirtboxlayouts.blogspot.com/2021/02/dunwich-cthulhu-fuzz-1-knob-silicon.html)). This is a cool one-knob fuzz, and its tone doesn't even out as much above the 12th fret, instead retaining fuzz characteristics.

The name from this pedal is based on [whippoorwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_whip-poor-will), a bird with an eerie nighttime call that features in many HP Lovecraft stories (as does Cthulhu). Per wikipedia, New England suggests that whippoorwills can sense a soul departing and capture it. Whippoorwills are in the nightjar family, one of my favorite familites of birds because they're just so weird looking.

If you'd like to just get started, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/WhippoorwillFuzz/WhippoorwillFuzz.zip) for fabrication.

There is one hard-to-source part in this build, the 2N5008. I couldn't find it anywhere and saw a recommendation to instead try a 2N4123, which works OK. The ubiquitous 2N5088 and 2N3904 also work. My personal preference among these three was the 2N3904, but they all sound similar. I can't compare with the 2N5008, which I couldn't source.

If you want, an [interactive BOM](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/WhippoorwillFuzz/interactive_bom.html) is also available if you want the option of sorting components or highlighting them on the board.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure.
* Sockets (for the transistors).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal only has one knob, so there's no established drilling layout.
