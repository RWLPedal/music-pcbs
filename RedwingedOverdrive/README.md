# Red-winged Overdrive

The *Red-winged Overdrive* is a PCB based on the ElectroHarmonix Hot Tubes, an early CMOS-based overdrive. All components should be easy to source, though note there's a few capacitor and resistor values which are less common. The Red-winged Overdrive is a versatile, warm, tube-sounding overdrive.

The name for the pedal comes from the color scheme of the Hot Tubes: red and black. It's named for the [Red-winged Blackbird](https://ebird.org/species/rewbla), a medium-sized black bird with bright red and yellow epaulets, common across North America (typically in swamps and wetlands). Black-birds have a distinctive mechanical clockwork song.

If you'd like to just get started with the build, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/RedwingedOverdrive/gerber.zip) for fabrication.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure
* Sockets (for the ICs).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal follows the drill conventions for the 
[125B Three-Knob with Switch layout](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/DRILLING.md).
