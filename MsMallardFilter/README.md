# Ms Mallard Filter

The *Ms Mallard Filter* is a PCB based on the [Nurse Quacky](https://home-wrecker.com/nurse-quacky.html) from Homewrecker, an envelope filter. This in turn is based on the JD Sleep Dr. Q. A related pedal is the Dr. Quack. Lots of ducks here!

The pedal is named after the [mallard duck](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Mallard/id) - far and away the most ubiquitous duck in the US. I'd originally called this pedal Mr. Mallard - but male mallards don't quack, only the females do. In fact, quacking is fairly unusual for ducks. I thought this was a fun fact for the pedal.

If you'd like to just get started, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/MsMallardFilter/MsMallardFilter.zip) for fabrication.


## Bill of materials

You can find an [interactive BOM](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/MsMallardFilter/interactive_bom.html), which contains all reference numbers, component counts, and more. But it should not be necessary for populating the pedal.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure.
* Sockets (for the transistor and IC).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal uses the standard layout [3-knob layout](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/DRILLING.md).

### Offboard wiring

Offboard wiring is standard for this pedal. See the [detailed offboard wiring instructions](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/WIRING.md) if you want more specifics.
