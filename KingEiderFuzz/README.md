# King Eider Fuzz

<img src="images/kingeider_fuzz.png?raw=true" alt="Cover image with gutshot" height="500px">

The *King Eider Fuzz* is a PCB based on the Catalinbread Katzenkönig. It also has a clipping switch, as with the AionFX Poseidon. The Katzenkönig is a combination of a Tone Bender and a RAT, and it absolutely rips. The original Katzenkönig was published with a schematic licensed under Creative Commons, which this layout also uses as a license.

The name for this pedal, the [King Eider](https://ebird.org/species/kineid), is based on the Katzenkönig name - literally Cat King. So another king is approporiate. The King Eider is an arctic duck with a girthy, magnificent bill.

If you'd like to just get started with the build, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/KingEiderFuzz/gerber.zip) for fabrication.

You may want to take a look at the [interactive BOM](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/KingEiderFuzz/interactive_bom.html).

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure
* Sockets (for the ICs).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal has a unique layout. Drill holes are in the same position as the [125B Five-Knob, LED Top layout](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/DRILLING.md), but the bottom center potentiometer is replaced with the SPDT switch. You can use the same layout but the diameter of that hole will be 6.6mm.

### Offboard wiring

Offboard wiring is standard for this pedal. See the [detailed offboard wiring instructions](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/WIRING.md) if you want more specifics.

## Versions

This pedal went through a few iterations as I corrected mistakes, but it's been working from the start.

* V1.3 - Minor tweaks for ergonomics after building (moving capacitors away from pot pads, text tweaks).
* V1.2 - Moved pots, other cleanup. Verified as working. Very close to V1.3 layout.
* V1.1 - Pots in wrong location. Never built.
* V1.0 - First version, verified as working, but layout felt untidy.
