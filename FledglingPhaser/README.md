# Fledgling Phaser

The *Fledgling Phaser* is a PCB based on Dylan159's [Perfectly Usable Phaser (PUP) Litter of Four](https://bentfishbowl.wixsite.com/electronics/post/pup-a-host-of-perfectly-usable-phasers). This circuit was an attempt to build a workable phaser that didn't require maching JFETs. The result is a phaser that... sounds like a phaser, with all cheap commodity parts. Dylan159 created a number of variations (at the linked page), including a single-FET phaser, a 2-stage, 4-stage, trimless 4-stage and 6-stage. This is the regular 4-stage phaser.

The name is unfortunately fairly dull. Since the original is called a "PUP," this is named for the bird equivalent. What can I say, I thought it was clever at the time.

If you'd like to just get started, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/FledglingPhaser/gerber.zip) for fabrication.

All of the parts in this build should be easily sourced.

This is a mostly straightforward build, but if you want an [interactive BOM](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/FledglingPhaser/interactive_bom.html) is also available.

### Layout note

The control layout for this pedal was awkward (a single knob and switch), and I opted to use the same layout as you'd find for two potentiometers. But with a switch in place a potentiometer, the layout is slightly higher and may interfere with audio jacks. I built this with a [bulkier enclosed jack](https://stompboxparts.com/audio-jacks/1-4-ts-enclosed-jack-panel-mount-skinny-lug/) and it just barely fit over the lugs of the switch. You may opt instead for a [less enclosed](https://lovemyswitches.com/1-4-mono-jack-lumberg-klbm-3/) or [completely exposed](https://lovemyswitches.com/1-4-mono-jack-neutrik-rean-nys229/) jack, which I expect would be less likely to touch the board.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure.
* Sockets (for the ICs and diodes).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal uses a slightly unusual [two-knob layout](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/DRILLING.md), but the right knob is a toggle switch.

### Offboard wiring

Offboard wiring is standard for this pedal. See the [detailed offboard wiring instructions](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/WIRING.md) if you want more specifics.
