# RWL Pedal PCBs

![RWL Pedals Mascot, an Osprey](images/osprey.png)

This is a repository for sharing PCB layouts, and pedal-building advice. Most PCBs here are for effects pedals.

PCBs shared here follow consistent [conventions](instructions/CONVENTIONS.md) and [control layouts](instructions/DRILLING.md) to the extent possible. If you've never had PCBs fabricated before, check out the [fabrication instructions](instructions/FABRICATION.md) - it's easy and cheap to have PCBs manufactured.

## PCBs

### DIY-related PCBs

The following PCBs are DIY-related, meaning they are based on kits or from circuits shared on pedal-building forums. However, many are based on classic pedals (or are the basis for them).

## Guides

The following are guides for my layouts, or for pedal-building in general:

* [Conventions](instructions/CONVENTIONS.md) - Layout and placement conventions I attempt to follow.
* [Drilling](instructions/DRILLING.md) - Drill templates for RWL pedals.
* [Fabrication](instructions/FABRICATION.md) - How exactly do you turn Gerber files into physical PCBs? Learn more here.
* [KiCAD Files](KiCAD/KICAD_SETUP.md) - Files I use in KiCAD for my layouts (footprints and symbols) and how to install them.
* [Wiring](instructions/WIRING.md) - Shows how to wire all pedals I've shared.
