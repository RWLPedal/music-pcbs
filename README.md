This repository contains links to publically available PCBs, including Gerber files, which can be printed cheaply from any PCB fabricator.

## PCBs

Here's a list of my own PCBs based on DIY circuits, or my own designs:

## Guides

The following are guides for my layouts, or for pedal-building in general:

* [Drilling](instructions/DRILLING.md) - Drill templates for RWL pedals.
* [Fabrication](instructions/FABRICATION.md) - How exactly do you turn Gerber files into physical PCBs? Learn more here.
* [Wiring](instructions/WIRING.md) - Shows how to wire all pedals I've shared.

## Layout Conventions

For my layouts, I've attempted to apply the conventions below. I've found these make populating and testing the PCB as trouble-free as possible.

* **Layout**
  * *Control spacing* - following PedalPCB standard positions for knobs and switches. This ensures enclosures can be reused across pedals that have the same number of controls.
  * *Control layout* - for standard 3-knob overdrive/fuzz/distortion, *Volume* is at the top left of the pedal (when the pedal is in its enclosure) and *Fuzz/Gain* or similar is at the top right, with the bottom reserved for *Tone* or other controls.
  * Input/output pads: 2x audio jack grounding pads + DC positive/negative pads at top; IN/SW/GND/OUT on bottom. This is also the PedalPCB standard layout (some PedalPCB pedals have on-PCB input/output positive connections).
* **Components**
  * *Indicator LED* - All boards include the LED and LEDR onboard. They can simply be omitted if you would prefer to populate these offboard.
  * *ICs* - Always positioned with pin 1 at the upper left (this means the IC notch will be facing the top of the PCB).
  * *Electrolytic capacitors* - leads are positioned consistently across the entire PCB (ie, all negative leads might be facing the bottom, right, etc - according to the board).
* **Label/Silkscreen**
  * All input/output pads labeled with name on both front and back of the PCB. This is to prevent the most common source of errors I've encountered when I am testing/populating a PCB (connecting wires to the wrong pads).
  * All controls (potentiometers/switches) are labeled with name and value on front and back of the PCB. This is to prevent the second most common source of errors when I am populating a PCB (getting the potentiometer values mixed up). Having the name populated on the back allows easy reference when using a test platform to audition the PCB outside of a box, without needing to refer to the documentation.
  * For clarity, LED leads are labeled with +/- on front and back, rather than with other annotations like A/K, or simply showing the flat part of the LED package.
  * Capacitor leads are labeled with + on the front and back.
* **References**
  * Power and LED components are labeled with *?10?* references (such as *R100* for the first resistor in the power/LED section or *D101* for the second diode) to indicate that they are not part of the main circuit, which is numbered sequentially starting from 1.
* **Gerbers**
  * Gerber files provided with attribute values on the silkscreen, so no need to reference the BOM when populating the PCB. Attribute references are still available via screenshot in the build doc.
