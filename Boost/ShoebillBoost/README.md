# Shoebill Boost

![Example front of the enclosure and gutshot](images/front_guts.png?raw=true)

The *Shoebill Boost* is a PCB based on the Way Huge Angry Troll. While this is labeled a boost pedal, it's more like an overdrive, with a fair amount of dirt and a lot of boost. All components are easily sourced.

The name of this layout comes from the [Shoebill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoebill), one of the most distinctive and troll-looking birds out there. It's a very peculiar swamp bird that looks like a cross between a heron and a pelican. I thought it was a good fit for a troll-named pedal. 

If you'd like to just get started, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/Boost/ShoebillBoost/ShoebillBoost.zip) for fabrication.

## Bill of materials

You can find an [interactive BOM](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/Boost/SaturnineAntshrikeBoost/interactive_bom.html), which contains all reference numbers, component counts, and more. But it should not be neccessary for populating the pedal.

There are very few components for this build, and they're all easily sourced.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal fits into a 125B enclosure.
* Sockets (for the IC).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

This pedal uses the standard [two knob](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/DRILLING.md) layout.

### Offboard wiring

Offboard wiring is standard for this pedal. See the [detailed offboard wiring instructions](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/blob/main/instructions/WIRING.md) if you want more specifics.
