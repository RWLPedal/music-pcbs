# White-Throated Distortion

The *White-Throated Distortion* is a PCB based on [Dylan159's "Dudson Narrowcast,"](https://bentfishbowl.wixsite.com/electronics/post/dudson-narrowcast-v2) a redesign of the Hudson Broadcast. Notably, the redesign does not include a transformer, and uses only easy-to-obtain components and values (no OC71 transistor or 330U electrolytic capacitor). Dylan159 provides two schematics, a PNP and NPN version. This PCB is for the PNP version, and it sounds great, with a crunchy tube-like tone.

The White-Throated name for the PCB was chosen somewhat haphazardly. For those of us living in the Pacific Northwest, we are excited to see the [White-Throated Sparrow](https://ebird.org/species/whtspa), but it's very common in New York's Hudson Valley. It's a charming sparrow with a splash of yellow.

If you'd like to just get started with the build, you can go ahead and download the [gerber](https://github.com/RWLPedal/music-pcbs/raw/refs/heads/main/WhiteThroatedOverdrive/gerber.zip) for fabrication.

Note that the bypass indicator LED and LEDR are on the PCB, and are listed here in the BOM.

Dylan159 advises that:
* The BASS_CUT pot be replaced with a C10K if the pedal is set up for bass.
* The 2N3904 transistors are stand-ins, but to experiment with other NPN transistors if you'd like.

### Not listed

As with most guitar pedal BOMs, the following components are not listed above:

* Footswitch
* DC Jack
* 2x 1/4" audio jack
* Enclosure: this pedal will fit in a 125B enclosure
* Sockets (if you want to socket the transistors).
* Wire
* Solder

## Layout

The layout follows the PedalPCB layout conventions and positions for a 3-knob pedal with a single switch (the same layout as a [Chop Shop](https://www.pedalpcb.com/product/pcb051/), for example). Note that this layout convention has evolved over the past few years, and this layout follows the most recent convention as of early 2025, which has slightly more space between the lower knob and the switch than earlier iterations. You can also adapt a regular 3-knob enclosure, as the pots are in the same location. The LED is positioned to go in line between the two knobs at the top of the pedal.
